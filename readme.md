# Dynamic Hospital Bed Occupancy Dashboard

This project is based on the architectural design and prototypical implementation of a dynamic dashboard for monitoring bed occupancy in hospitals. It builds upon the foundational work detailed in a Bachelor's thesis and extends it into a practical, working prototype.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bed Monitoring**: Real-time updates of hospital bed occupancy.
- **Integration with Hospital Information Systems (HIS)**: Seamless data flow from existing systems without additional manual input (from HL7 messages).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive dashboard design with visual representations such as charts and color-coded indicators.
- **Built with Python and Django**: The backend is developed using Python with the Django web framework, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## Documentation

For more detailed information about the system architecture, design choices, and implementation details, please refer to the [Bachelor's thesis](./Bachelorarbeit.pdf) included in this repository.
